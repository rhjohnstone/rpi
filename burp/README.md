# Burping jelly baby

My attempt at the [classic project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/burping-jelly-baby), but using a gummy bear!

I didn't have any female-to-female jumper wires, so had to use female-to-male and use copper wire (stripped from an old USB cable) to attach the paper clips.
It was all very fiddly, and it was very difficult to get the paper clips close enough inside the gummy bear so that they touched when squeezed.
Several times, once they finally were close enough to touch when squeezed, they would remain in contact even after letting go.
This resulted in continuous burping...

I'm very glad I was able to get it working, even if not perfectly, and am happy to say that I will never do it again.
